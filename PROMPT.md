# AI Prompt: Recreate US Law Severity Map Project

This prompt can be used with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to recreate this entire project from scratch.

---

## Main Prompt

```
Create a complete, professional data visualization project that displays US law severity 
by state with comprehensive crime statistics. The project should be production-ready 
with AWS deployment infrastructure.

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS:

1. INTERACTIVE MAP FEATURES:
   - Choropleth map of all 50 US states
   - Click-to-zoom functionality with state-specific centering
   - Hover shows state name only
   - Click displays detailed statistics panel (squared box overlay on right side)
   - Double-click resets view and clears panel
   - Color gradient: green (lenient) → yellow → orange → red (severe)
   - Professional UI with smooth animations

2. DATA TO DISPLAY:
   
   Law Severity Metrics:
   - Severity score (0-100 scale):
     * 100: Very Severe (death penalty active)
     * 80-95: Severe (long sentences)
     * 40-60: Moderate (balanced approach)
     * 20-40: Lenient (rehabilitation focus)
   - Death penalty status (Active/Abolished/Moratorium)
   
   Crime Statistics (per 100,000 population):
   - Murder rate (with US average comparison)
   - Gun death rate (with US average comparison)
   - Traffic fatality rate (with US average comparison)
   
   Demographics:
   - Population (2023 estimates)

   ```

8. STATE DATA (All 50 states with complete info):
   - Use realistic estimates for crime statistics
   - Murder rates: 1.3 (NH) to 20.5 (MS)
   - Gun death rates: 3.7 (MA) to 28.6 (MS)
   - Traffic fatalities: 5.1 (MA) to 22.6 (WY)
   - Include all death penalty states correctly
   - Add historical context for each state

9. KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
   
   JavaScript Event Handling:
   - Use Plotly's .on('plotly_click') for state clicks

## Usage Instructions

### With Claude (Anthropic)
```
Copy the entire "Main Prompt" section above and paste it into a new Claude conversation.
Claude has excellent code generation and can handle complex multi-file projects.
```

### With ChatGPT (OpenAI)
```
Copy the prompt and paste into ChatGPT-4 or ChatGPT-4 Turbo.
May need to break into smaller parts for very long conversations.
Use Code Interpreter for testing the Python code.
```

### With Cursor AI
```
Open Cursor IDE and use Composer mode.
Paste the prompt to generate all files in your workspace.
Cursor can directly create the file structure and edit multiple files.
```

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Fresh**: Use a new conversation to avoid context confusion

2. **Specify Environment**: 
   ```
   Additional context: I'm on macOS with Python 3.11 installed.
   AWS CLI is configured. I want to use Terraform for deployment.
   ```

3. **Request Step-by-Step**:
   ```
   After generating the code, walk me through:
   1. Local setup and testing
   2. Terraform deployment
   3. GitHub Actions configuration
   ```

4. **Ask for Clarifications**:
   ```
   Before starting, confirm:
   - What Python version do you recommend?
   - Should I create a virtual environment?
   - What AWS region should I use?
   ```

5. **Iterate on Design**:
   ```
   The statistics panel looks good, but can you:
   - Make the border thicker
   - Add more spacing between sections
   - Change the color scheme to blue
   ```

---

## Key Success Factors

### ✅ Must Have
- Plotly for interactivity (NOT matplotlib static map)

- State-specific zoom coordinates for all 50 states
- Click shows stats + zooms simultaneously
- Double-click resets + hides stats
- All text in English
- Complete AWS infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Comprehensive documentation

### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using matplotlib instead of Plotly
- Using Plotly annotations instead of HTML overlay
- Generic zoom that doesn't center properly
- Missing state data
- Incomplete documentation
- No cost analysis
- Portuguese text in code/docs
- Missing Terraform files
- No CI/CD pipeline

```
Add these features:
- Search bar to find states
- Filter by severity category
- Export data as CSV
- Time-series animation
- Comparison mode (2 states side-by-side)
```

### Infrastructure Improvements
```
Enhance the AWS setup:
- Add custom domain with Route53
- Enable CloudWatch monitoring
- Set up cost alerts
- Add staging environment

## Troubleshooting

If the AI generates incorrect code:

1. **Re-iterate Requirements**:
   ```
   The map needs to use Plotly, not matplotlib.
   Please regenerate using plotly.graph_objects.Choroplethmapbox
   ```

2. **Request Specific Fixes**:
   ```
   The statistics panel is not showing. The issue is that it should be
   an HTML div element, not a Plotly annotation. Please fix.
   ```

3. **Ask for Explanations**:
   ```
   Why did you choose this approach for state centering?
   Can you explain the zoom level calculation?
   ```

---

## Maintenance

To keep this prompt updated:

1. **After Major Changes**: Update the specifications
2. **New Features**: Add to "Customization Options"
3. **Version Bumps**: Update version information
